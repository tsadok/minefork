description = Minefork is my attempt to create an essentially complete non-combat mine-and-build game experience in the Minetest engine.  It is based on Dreambuilder, by Vanessa Dannenberg, which in turn is based on minetest_game, the base game content package maintained by Minetest engine game developers, and should be compatible with most modules written for either; but it is my intention that you should generally not need additional modules for a peaceful-mode game: I have attempted to include everything that is needed.  Some components of Dreambuilder (and one component of MTG) have been removed because they are at odds with my design philosophy for the game.  Specifically, it is my intention that players should build things, and so I have removed modules that were focused instead on crafting prefab single-node versions of complex objects and merely placing them in the world.  When a player is building a house and wants to put e.g. a swimming pool in the back yard, I want them to build the swimming pool out of existing blocks, not search through the recipe book for a "swimming pool" object that they can craft and place as a single node.  Similar logic applies to things like tables and chairs:  they can be built in the world, the same as anything else.  However, this does not apply to important functional things (like the grinders and furnaces and whatnot that are used to process materials); on the contrary, I have attempted to supply enough materials-processing options to allow players to build up their infrastructure and acquire large quantities of building materials, and this means that useful building materials like clay and sandstone and glass can be readily made, in bulk and in a variety of colors, from abundant materials.  The major exception is combat:  Minefork is intended to be a peaceful game experience, so if you want combat, you will need additional modules.
