How to use the wall knob:
Connect to a digiline, right-click, and set the channel and the minimum and maximum values.
Left-click to decrease the current setting or right-click to increase it. If the "protected" checkbox was checked, then only players allowed to interact in the area can do this.
Each time the setting is changed, the new setting is sent on the selected channel.
Note that the settings cannot be changed after setting - you must dig and re-place the knob to do so.
