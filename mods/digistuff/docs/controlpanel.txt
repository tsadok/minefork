How to use the digilines control panel:
Once a channel is set, any messages sent on that channel will be shown on the "LCD". The buttons, when pressed, send the messages "up", "down", "left", "right", "back", and "enter" on the same channel. If the panel is placed in a protected area (all standard protection mods are supported), only the owner of the area (and players with the protection_bypass privilege) can set the channel. There is also a "lock" function in the bottom-right of the "LCD" area. Click the padlock icon to lock/unlock it. If locked, only the owner of the area is allowed to use the buttons. If unlocked, anyone can use the buttons, although channel setting and (for reasons that shuld be obvious) locking/unlocking is still limited to the area owner and players with protection_bypass.
