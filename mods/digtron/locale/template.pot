"A builder head is the most complex component of this system. It has period "

"by placing an example of the block type that you want it to build.\n"
"\n"
"When the \"Save & Show\" button is clicked the properties for period and "
"offset will be saved, and markers will briefly be shown to indicate where "
"the nearest spots corresponding to those values are. The builder will build "
"its output at those locations provided it is moving along the matching "
"axis.\n"
"\n"
"There is also an \"Extrusion\" setting. This allows your builder to extrude "
"a line of identical blocks from the builder output, in the direction the "
"output side is facing, until it reaches an obstruction or until it reaches "
"the extrusion limit. This can be useful for placing columns below a bridge, "
"or for filling a large volume with a uniform block type without requiring a "
"large number of builder heads.\n"
"\n"
"The \"output\" side of a builder is the side with a black crosshair on it.\n"
"\n"
"Builders also have a \"facing\" setting. If you haven't memorized the "
"meaning of the 24 facing values yet, builder heads have a helpful \"Read & "
"Save\" button to fill this value in for you. Simply build a temporary "
"instance of the block in the output location in front of the builder, adjust "
"it to the orientation you want using the screwdriver tool, and then when you "
"click the \"Read & Save\" button the block's facing will be read and saved.\n"
"\n"
"Note: if more than one builder tries to build into the same space "
"simultaneously, it is not predictable which builder will take priority. One "
"will succeed and the other will fail. You should arrange your builders to "
"avoid this for consistent results."

"Digtron blocks can be used to construct highly customizable and modular "
"tunnel-boring machines, bridge-builders, road-pavers, wall-o-matics, and "
"other such construction/destruction contraptions.\n"
"\n"
"The basic blocks that can be assembled into a functioning digging machine "
"are:\n"
"\n"
"* Diggers, which excavate material in front of them when the machine is "
"triggered\n"
"* Builders, which build a user-configured block in front of them\n"
"* Inventory modules, which hold material produced by the digger and provide "
"material to the builders\n"
"* Control block, used to trigger the machine and move it in a particular "
"direction.\n"
"\n"
"A digging machine's components must be connected to the control block via a "
"path leading through the faces of the blocks - diagonal connections across "
"edges and corners don't count."

msgid "Concepts"
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:268
msgid ""
"Several general concepts are important when building more sophisticated "
"diggers.\n"
"\n"
"Facing - a number between 0-23 that determines which direction a block is "
"facing and what orientation it has. Not all blocks make use of facing (basic "
"blocks such as cobble or sand have no facing, for example) so it's not "
"always necessary to set this when configuring a builder head. The facing of "
"already-placed blocks can be altered through the use of the screwdriver "
"tool.\n"
"\n"
"Period - Builder and digger heads can be made periodic by changing the "
"period value to something other than 1. This determines how frequently they "
"trigger. A period of 1 triggers on every block, a period of 2 triggers once "
"every second block, a period of 3 triggers once every third block, etc. "
"These are useful when setting up a machine to place regularly-spaced "
"features as it goes. For example, you could have a builder head that places "
"a torch every 8 steps, or a digger block that punches a landing in the side "
"of a vertical stairwell at every level.\n"
"\n"
"Offset - The location at which a periodic module triggers is globally "
"uniform. This is handy if you want to line up the blocks you're building "
"(for example, placing pillars and a crosspiece every 4 blocks in a tunnel, "
"or punching alcoves in a wall to place glass windows). If you wish to change "
"how the pattern lines up, modify the \"offset\" setting.\n"
"\n"
"Shift-right-clicking - since most of the blocks of the digging machine have "
"control screens associated with right-clicking, building additional blocks "
"on top of them or rotating them with the screwdriver requires the shift key "
"to be held down when right-clicking on them.\n"
"\n"
"Traction - Digtrons cannot fly. By default, they need to be touching one "
"block of solid ground for every three blocks of Digtron in order to move. "
"Digtrons can fall, though - traction is never needed when a Digtron is "
"moving downward. \"Pusher\" controllers can ignore the need for traction "
"when moving in any direction."

#: doc.lua:282
msgid "Audio cues"
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:284
msgid ""
"When a digging machine is unable to complete a cycle it will make one of "
"several noises to indicate what the problem is. It will also set its "
"mouseover text to explain what went wrong.\n"
"\n"
"Squealing traction wheels indicates a mobility problem. If the squealing is "
"accompanied by a buzzer, the digging machine has encountered an obstruction "
"it can't dig through. This could be a protected region (the digging machine "
"has only the priviledges of the player triggering it), a chest containing "
"items, or perhaps the digger was incorrectly designed and can't dig the "
"correctly sized and shaped cavity for it to move forward into. There are "
"many possibilities.\n"
"\n"
"Squealing traction wheels with no accompanying buzzer indicates that the "
"digging machine doesn't have enough solid adjacent blocks to push off of. "
"Tunnel boring machines cannot fly or swim, not even through lava, and they "
"don't dig fast enough to \"catch sick air\" when they emerge from a "
"cliffside. If you wish to cross a chasm you'll need to ensure that there are "
"builder heads placing a solid surface as you go. If you've built a very tall "
"digtron with a small surface footprint you may need to improve its traction "
"by adding structural modules that touch the ground.\n"
"\n"
"A buzzer by itself indicates that the Digtron has run out of fuel. There may "
"be traces remaining in the hopper, but they're not enough to execute the "
"next dig/build cycle.\n"
"\n"
"A ringing bell indicates that there are insufficient materials in inventory "
"to supply all the builder heads for this cycle.\n"
"\n"
"A short high-pitched honk means that one or more of the builder heads don't "
"have an item set. A common oversight, especially with large and elaborate "
"digging machines, that might be hard to notice and annoying to fix if not "
"noticed right away.\n"
"\n"
"Splashing water sounds means your Digtron is digging adjacent to (or "
"through) water-containing blocks. Digtrons are waterproof, but this might be "
"a useful indication that you should take care when installing doors in the "
"tunnel walls you've placed here.\n"
"\n"
"A triple \"voop voop voop!\" alarm indicates that there is lava adjacent to "
"your Digtron. Digtrons can't penetrate lava by default, and this alarm "
"indicates that a non-lava-proof Digtron operator may wish to exercise "
"caution when opening the door to clear the obstruction."

msgid "Tips and Tricks"
msgstr ""

#: doc.lua:304
msgid ""
"To more easily visualize the operation of a Digtron, imagine that its cycle "
"of operation follows these steps in order:\n"
"\n"
"* Dig\n"
"* Move\n"
"* Build\n"
"* Allow dust to settle (ie, sand and gravel fall)\n"
"\n"
"If you're building a repeating pattern of blocks, your periodicity should be "
"one larger than your largest offset. For example, if you've laid out "
"builders to create a set of spiral stairs and the offsets are from 0 to 11, "
"you'll want to use periodicity 12.\n"
"\n"
"A good way to program a set of builders is to build a complete example of "
"the structure you want them to create, then place builders against the "
"structure and have them \"read\" all of its facings. This also lets you more "
"easily visualize the tricks that might be needed to allow the digtron to "
"pass through the structure as it's being built."
