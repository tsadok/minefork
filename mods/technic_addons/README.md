# Technic Addons 
This mod was originally made for the https://playminetest.com server on the request of a player to add MK2 and MK3 chainsaws. However I took it a step up and added a few more additions as well to turn it into a full fledge addon mod! Below are the additions made to the mod... 
 
# Chainsaws

# Cans

Below are the specs of the additional cans! 
- Medium: Holds 32 to 64 liters depending on can type 
- Large: Holds 128 to 256 liters depending on can type

All textures and coding was based off of Technic which it's repository is https://github.com/mt-mods/technic and therefore the unmodified portions of the coding and textures still belongs to the original Technic mod creator(s).
